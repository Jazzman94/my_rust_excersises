# my_rust_excersises
This repository is primarily created for my educational purposes, set up publicly to ease sharing with others. It tracks my journey into the Rust language. I'm adding exercises that I find interesting during my learning of the basics from [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). Later on, I would like to tackle exercises from [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) and work on even more interesting projects.

## List of Exercises
- [x] guessing_game: Guessing games (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- [x] carol: Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html)
- [x] fibonacci_sequance: Generate the nth Fibonacci number.

## How to Run Exercises
Each exercise has its own directory, with the code in the src file. To run you can use cargo run or rustc commands
